This is a repository for a final project of mine in the Kode Kampus' Front End Web-Development Workshop.

This project aims to create a barebones but fully functional and working webpage of Twitter Dash,
where you can view user's names and posts, as well as a search them by name.

Made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

API requests from the webpage are made to this website that provides example data:
